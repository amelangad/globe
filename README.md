This is my first project with three.js
How to run this project:
1. Install node.js with npm package from node.js website
2. run 'npm init' in yout terminal


In this project i used to webpack(webpack.js.org)and three.js (threejs.org)



I first time used a webpack and any library (and i'm writing this readme 1 year after...), so i don't remember why i have "three.js" in the dev dependences too(becouse in depencences i have it too) and i'm confused.. I tried to build all website but I can't use canvas like an element of page... But i will be tr:) If U want to give me an advice about it, i will be glad :)
